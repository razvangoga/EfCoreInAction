# EfCoreInAction - [article](https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/net-development/building-better-entity-framework-applications/)

Welcome to the Git repo that is associated with the book 
**[Entity Framework Core in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/entity-framework-core-in-action?a_aid=su4utaraxuTre8tuthup&a_bid=4cef27ce)**
published by [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/).

The **Entity Framework Core in Action** book details how to use 
[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/index) (EF Core)
to develop database access code in [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net) applications. 

This Git repo contains all the code in the book, plus an 
[example book selling site](http://efcoreinaction.com/) 
that I develop, and improve, in the book.
All the code uses Microsoft's, open-source 
[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/index) library for database access.

# Where's the code!

This repo has a branch-per-chapter, and sometime and branch-per-section, approach
so if you are looking at the master branch then you won't see any code!
Just click the [Branches](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreInAction/branches) on the site and you will
find all the branches I have created so far.

## NOTE: Now updated to Visual Studio 2017 format

Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017) is the recommended version of Visual Studio for developing .NET Core applications.
The whole solution has been rebuild to use .csprog and to swap over to the recommended folder structure,
which has the projects at the top level.

## Live example book selling site

You can find a live verison of the [example books selling site](http://efcoreinaction.com/).
This provides an online example of the site to look at. You can't edit the data on the live site for obvious reasons,
but you can if you clone the git this Git repo and run the example application locally.
You can 'buy a book' though on the live site, and even see your old 'purchases'.

The **Logs** navigation button will show you the SQL code that EF Core used to implement the last command you used.

*Note: The admin button is missing on the live site.*

## Database naming conventions

Because the database structure can change in each branch I use a system of building the database name 
using the branch name from a file which is written by a small gulpfile that is run by Visual Studio #
on every build.

Also I use [xUnit unit tests](https://xunit.github.io/) which run in parallel, so I cannot use one
database for all the tests, as they would all be changing the database at one time.
I therefore use another system to append the test class name, and sometimes the method that ran.
**This is all explained in chapter 11**, but I wanted to warn you you will get lots of databases 
if you run the unit tests.

If you get fed up with all databases there is a unit test in 
[test/UnitCommands/DeleteAllUnitTestDatabases](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreInAction/blob/Chapter02/Test/UnitCommands/DeleteAllUnitTestDatabases.cs)
that will delete all the unit test databases in the branch you are in.

My own blog site is at http://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/ where you will find articles on EF 6.x
and some on EF Core.

Happy coding!
